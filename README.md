Cards to test laser cutting machines

## Engrave Test Card
The engrave test card has 10 squares, ranging from 100% to 10% gray scale in steps of 10%. It also has a gray scale gradient and 3 different sizes of text to test resolution and how easy to read text is on different settings. While running this card once to test calibration is a good, its worth while running it a few times on different settings to see the contrast between grays and the readability of text on various settings.

## Cut Test Card
The cut test card has 4 shapes, horizontal lines, vertical lines, 45 degree diagonal lines, a tight zigzag, a tight wave, some text, and 1 inch and 1/2 inch finger joint tests. This card only needs to be ran until a good configuration is found, where everything cuts, theres minimal burning on the backside and edges, and (ideally) even the small void spaces of the text falls out.
