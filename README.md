# LaserCutterTestCards
 Uniform 3x5 Cards to test laser cutting machines

## Engrave Test Card
The engrave test card has 10 squares, ranging from 100% to 10% gray scale in steps of 10%. It also has a gray scale gradient and 3 different sizes of text to test resolution and how obvious text is on different settings. While running this card once to test calibration is a good, its worth while running it a few times on different settings to see the contrast between grays and the readability of text on various settings.

## Cut Test Card
The cut test card is a moderately brutal test with 4 shapes, horizontal lines, vertical lines, 45 degree diagonal lines, a tight zig,zag, a tight wave, and some text. This card only needs to be ran until a good configuration is found, where everything cuts, theres minimal burning on the backside and edges, and (ideally) even the small void spaces of the text falls out. The text can be omitted as it might be particularly difficult for lower end machines.
